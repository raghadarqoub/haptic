# My React App

This is a simple React project created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). It serves as a starting point for building more complex React applications.

## Project Structure

- `public/` – Contains static files like `index.html`, `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, and `robots.txt`.
- `src/` – The main source folder where React components and application logic live.
- `node_modules/` – Auto-generated folder containing installed packages.
- `package.json` – Defines the project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json` – Locks the versions of the installed packages.
- `.gitignore` – Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md` – Project documentation (you are reading it!).

## Getting Started

To run the project locally: 

### 1. Install Dependencies
